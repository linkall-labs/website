note: "As we’re just getting started, many of the capabilities mentioned above are not currently available on Vanus. For example, there are very few connectors we currently provide, and workload orchestration functions are not yet supported. But If we head the right way, we will definitely reach our goal. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join us and make Vanus stronger!"

## What is Vanus?

Vanus is a serverless event streaming system with event capture, storage, filter, and routing that can help you trigger and orchestrate serverless workloads and Kubernetes applications. Vanus provides hundreds of cloud services and application software connectors, enabling developers to route events from almost any data source to serverless workloads, helping enterprises to quickly build Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) applications, which is the core foundation of future digital enterprise facilities.

Developers can quickly build cloud-native intelligent digital pipelines with Vanus. Whether it is a public cloud, a hybrid cloud, or an edge cloud, Vanus makes it easy and convenient for enterprises to use data just like water, gas, and electricity.

Vanus has rich build-in event sources and sinks and enables users to integrate Internet of Things (IoT) event, AI event, Databases, customized/SaaS applications, and cloud service products.

## What can you do with Vanus?

Build Event-Driven Applications, such as e-commerce systems and AI.

Build cloud-native intelligent digital pipelines in minutes.

Build IoT event processing system, such as a shared power bank.

## Why Vanus?

The goal of Vanus is to help users to build responsive and Event-Driven applications. Whenever an event occurs in the real world, Vanus can trigger serverless workloads to react to the event.

• Any Event: The Connector Development toolkit (CDK) can complete the development of the Connector in 1 hour, helping users to quickly accomplish event access. In the future, Vanus will provide plentiful connectors, allowing users to get the events they want from almost any system, whether services, databases, IoT devices, or SaaS systems.

• Any Workload: In response to events, Vanus can deliver events to any workload, whether traditional applications, serverless applications, database systems, or others.

• Any Scale: Vanus provides autoscaling of the entire link. Workloads are automatically scaled with the amount of requests, and can be scaled down to 0 when there is no traffic.

• Any Where: Vanus provides multi-cloud and hybrid cloud integration capabilities to deliver events wherever you want, whether it’s a public cloud, on-premises, or edge cloud.
